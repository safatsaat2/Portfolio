JavaScript is my primary programming language, and I have honed my skills in its development. My expertise lies in creating captivating frontend UIs using ReactJS, complemented by the powerful React Router for efficient routing.

            To ensure a visually appealing and responsive application, I employ CSS framework Tailwind, along with various Tailwind extensions such as Daisy UI and Flowbite. For the backend, I rely on Node.js with Express.js, and I prefer working with MongoDB, a versatile NoSQL database that offers comprehensive developer data management capabilities.
